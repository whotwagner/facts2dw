#facts2dw.rb
Simple script which converts ansible facts into dokuwiki-format and uploads it via xmlrpc-interface into dokuwiki			  
    								  
This script uses http-basic-authentication and ssl to login into	  
dokuwiki. Ansible caches all the facts in <ANSIBLE-DIR>/facts	  
so it is quite easy to import all facts into dokuwiki using the	  
following line: 

```
for i in `ls *`; do facts2dw.rb $i; done		  
```    								  

To upload all the changes whenever they occur I would recommend       
using inotify.							  
    								  
It is very easy to change this script to use puppet-facts instead of  
ansible-facts. If puppetdb is installed all the facts can fetched via 
the rest interface. It's just a matter of few lines. 		  
Of course the jason-structur will look different, but it will be      
easy to modify this very simple script. I would recommend to 	  
use the debug-code which executes 'pp', to dump the jason-hash.       

BTW: don't forget to configure the xmlrpc-access in dokuwiki proberly!
